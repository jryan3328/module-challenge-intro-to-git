## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A Version Comparing Program
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the languange, Hub is the cloud where everything is stored.
3. Why do we create a branch? So we're only changing code on our end.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To compare changes in code.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout -b user-name
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull updates the branch to the latest version. 
What does each command do? fetch extracts info about the last commit. merge merges all the commits together for a final branch. pull
7. What is a merge conflict? when you use git merge and 2 or more branches are conflicting.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? using pull requests and comparing/running tests.
